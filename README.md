# Great Sage

A local-first Windows desktop AI companion, built around a 3D HUD rather
than a chat window. Everything runs on your machine: the model, the
speech recognition, and the voice.

- **Talk to it.** Hold one key from anywhere - including inside a game -
  say what you want, let go. Transcribed locally with faster-whisper.
- **It answers in a cloned voice**, synthesised locally with F5-TTS.
- **It does things.** Opens pages, launches applications, opens folders,
  searches the web and YouTube, reads your screen, reports free VRAM and
  disk, sets reminders.
- **A HUD, not a text box.** A Three.js scene that reacts to speech and
  to what it is doing, with a compact always-on-top overlay mode that
  clicks straight through to whatever is behind it.
- **Two looks.** Great Sage, and Raphael - a second scene with its own
  bloom, glare and water, switched from a dropdown. Each keeps its own
  settings.

Named for the skill in *That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime*, and it
addresses you as Master.

## Coding Agent Companion (the default mode)

Out of the box (`APP_MODE = "companion"` in `great_sage/config/settings.py`)
Great Sage is a lightweight companion for **Claude Code and Codex**: it
watches every session on this machine and reacts to what the agents do.

- **Voice lines for what is happening** - starting work, running tests,
  tests passed or failed, a destructive command, done, needs you - played
  from pre-made Great Sage clips (`core/agent_scenarios.py`), real
  recordings first. Nothing is translated or synthesised while you code,
  so it loads no TTS model, no translator and no speech recogniser, and
  it does not need Ollama running.
- **Rolling subtitles** of the agents' notes and replies, and an
  **activity row** per session (click it to bring the agent's app forward,
  or mute that project).
- **Permission alerts** through a Claude Code `Notification` hook
  (`great_sage/hooks/claude_notify.py`), since permission prompts never
  reach the session logs.
- **Replay** a past session into the running Companion to check how it
  looks and sounds: `py -m great_sage.core.replay`.

The scenario clips clone the voice reference, so they are not in the
repository: generate them once with `py -m great_sage.voice.make_agent_clips`
(needs the full install's XTTS). `APP_MODE = "full"` restores the original
assistant described below.

## What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| Windows | 10 or 11 |
| [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) | running locally, with `ollama pull qwen3.5:4b` |
| Python 3.14 | the app itself |
| Python 3.11 | a second venv, for the overlay window only |
| NVIDIA GPU | not required, but F5-TTS is too slow to speak in real time on CPU. Developed on a 3060 (12GB) |

The two Python versions are not a mistake. The transparent overlay needs
PySide6 6.4.3, which has no build for 3.14; newer Qt flickers through
ANGLE on a translucent always-on-top window. So the overlay is a separate
process on 3.11 and the main app runs on 3.14. See `NOTES.md`.

## Install

**[Full step-by-step guide, with troubleshooting -> INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**
Start there if anything goes wrong, particularly if it replies in text but
never speaks.

The short version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shogunyan12/The-GREAT-SAGE.git
cd The-GREAT-SAGE

# torch FIRST, with the CUDA build for your GPU - otherwise pip resolves
# the CPU build and the voice is unusably slow. Check yours with nvidia-smi.
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install -r requirements.txt

# The overlay's own environment
py -3.11 -m venv .overlay-venv
.overlay-venv\Scripts\pip install PySide6==6.4.3

ollama pull qwen3.5:4b
```

## Run

```bash
py app.py
```

First launch downloads the F5-TTS and faster-whisper models (a few GB,
once). After that it is fully offline apart from web search and anything
you ask it to fetch.

## Use

| | |
|---|---|
| **Alt+1** | hold to talk, release to send. Works from any window |
| **Click the core** | opens the radial menu: settings, chat, logs, overlay |
| **F1** | shows and hides the developer chrome |
| **Esc** | closes whatever is open |

Say things like *"what time is it"*, *"open spotify"*, *"search the web
for..."*, *"search on youtube for X and play the first video"*, *"look at
my screen"*. Requests to DO something are carried out and not narrated -
it opens the thing and says nothing.

## Themes

**Settings -> Theme** switches between **Great Sage** and **Raphael**.

Only the home visuals and the overlay change. The interface, the voice,
the chats and the keybinds are shared, and each theme keeps its own copy
of every visual slider - move one on Raphael and Great Sage is untouched,
switch back and your settings are still there.

Raphael is a different scene rather than a different palette: a
twelve-sided core, rings of turning script, and a screen-space bloom
stage that Great Sage never runs. That stage costs about six points of
GPU on a 3060 at 1904x1041, and only while Raphael is the active theme.

## Build a standalone exe

```bash
py build.py
```

Produces `dist/GreatSage/` (about 5.5 GB - it carries torch, F5-TTS and
Whisper) and puts a shortcut on your Desktop. Two bundles are built and
merged: the app on 3.14 and the overlay on 3.11.

The build runs three checks first and refuses to package if any fail:

```bash
py check_js.py         # the inline HUD script parses at all
py check_shaders.py    # GLSL template literals are balanced
py check_routing.py    # asking it to do something actually does it
```

`check_routing.py` is the important one. The failure it guards against is
not a crash - it is Great Sage confidently answering "I cannot do that"
to something it can do. Several cases in it are transcripts of real
requests that were refused.

## Configuration

`great_sage/config/settings.py` holds everything tunable: the model, the
system prompt, voice engine and speed, the global hotkey. Most of it is
also reachable from the settings panel in the app, which is the better
place to change it.

Your data - conversations, memories, API keys, settings - is written
beside the exe (or in the project folder when run from source) and is
never committed.

## Project layout

```
app.py                  entry point; checks prerequisites, then the HUD
run_hud.py              the native window and the WebSocket bridge
overlay_window.py       the transparent overlay + settings/history windows
hud_prototype.html      the entire HUD: Three.js scene, chat, settings
build.py                two-bundle PyInstaller build
check_*.py              the gates the build will not ship without

great_sage/
  config/settings.py    every tunable value
  models/               ModelProvider interface + Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic
  core/
    chat_engine.py      conversation, tool loop
    tools.py            the 16 tools, and the deterministic pre-routing
    memory*.py          long-term memory
    state.py            internal state that shapes replies
    autonomy.py         scheduled tasks and folder watching
  voice/
    f5_tts_engine.py    cloned-voice synthesis
    speech_to_text.py   faster-whisper
assets/sfx/             interface sounds
voice_samples/          the voices Great Sage speaks with
```

`NOTES.md` has the history and the environment quirks. Read it before
touching `voice/` or `config/settings.py` - most of what looks like an
odd choice in there is load-bearing and the reason is written down.

## Known limitations

- **Windows only.** The overlay, the global hotkey and the window
  handling are all Win32.
- **The model is small.** qwen3.5:4b was chosen to leave GPU headroom for
  gaming while it runs. It is not reliable at deciding to use a tool,
  which is why the requests that matter are pre-routed deterministically
  rather than left to it.
- **First launch is slow** and needs the network, for the model
  downloads.
- **No test suite for the Python core.** The three checks above cover the
  HUD script and the routing table; the rest is verified by running it.
- **Image generation is not implemented**, deliberately.

Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime*, used here for a personal companion
project. They are not mine and are included for that purpose only.
