"""Great Sage - the single entry point, and what the packaged exe runs.

Checks prerequisites first. If anything essential is missing it shows the
setup window; otherwise it goes straight to the HUD, so a machine that is
already set up never sees a splash it has to click through.

Run from source:   py app.py
Force setup:       py app.py --setup

Everything is done in ONE process rather than launching a second one. In a
frozen build sys.executable is the exe itself, so re-launching a .py file
is not an option, and spawning a child would leave the parent alive with
the HUD unable to fully exit when closed.
