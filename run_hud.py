Great Sage HUD - native app entry point.

Opens hud_prototype.html in its own window (via pywebview) and runs the
local WebSocket bridge (great_sage/server.py) that connects it to the
real ChatEngine + voice output, replacing the HUD's canned test-button
behavior with the actual AI.

This is additive: main.py's CLI mode (`py main.py`) is untouched and
still works exactly as before. Run this instead with `py run_hud.py`.
