        This matters enormously for a spoken assistant. Ollama reports a

        content - so with it on, nothing arrives on the content stream
        until the model has finished deliberating. Measured on qwen3:8b
        with an identical question:

            thinking on  -> first content at 14.13s (857 chars of it)
            thinking off -> first content at  1.15s

        Same model, same prompt, 12x difference in how long the user
        waits before anything can be spoken. Off is the right default for
        conversation; turn it on deliberately for a hard problem where
        the extra time buys something.

        Harmless on models without a thinking mode - Ollama ignores the
        field, so llama3 and friends behave exactly as before.
