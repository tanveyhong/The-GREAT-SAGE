"""
Streams synthesized/pre-recorded audio to a connected HUD browser client
instead of playing it through local speakers, so the HUD's own Web Audio
analyser (already tuned for real audio-reactive pulsing in
hud_prototype.html) drives the visuals from genuine playback - Python
doesn't need to separately compute or forward amplitude data.

speak() on the voice engine is documented to block until playback
finishes, so play()/play_file() here send the audio over the websocket
and then block on an ack ("audio_ended") that the HUD sends once its
<audio> element actually finishes playing - see great_sage/server.py's
protocol docstring for the full message shapes.
