"""
Local WebSocket bridge between the HUD (hud_prototype.html, opened in a
pywebview window by run_hud.py) and the real AI backend - a ChatEngine
plus an optional VoiceOutput. Only used by the HUD app; main.py's CLI
mode doesn't import this at all.

Protocol (JSON text frames, one field "type" per message):

  Client -> Server:
    {"type": "chat", "text": "..."}       - user typed a message
    {"type": "audio_ended"}                - the HUD's <audio> element

                                              HUD - it gets "log" messages,
                                              never audio/reply ones, and
                                              never becomes voice's active

Multiple connections are expected at once - the main HUD window, and one
subscribe_logs connection per open console window - but this is a local
companion app, not a multi-user service.
