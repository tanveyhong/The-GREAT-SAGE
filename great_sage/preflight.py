"""What is missing before Great Sage can run, and how to get it.

Detection only - nothing here installs, downloads, or changes anything, so
it is safe to call on every startup and from the installer UI alike. The
installer decides what to act on; this module only reports.

Three of Great Sage's dependencies cannot travel inside the application:

  Ollama          a separate background service, installed system-wide
  the chat model  ~1.9GB, managed by Ollama in its own store
  WebView2        the Microsoft runtime the HUD window renders through

A fourth, the voice model weights, CAN be bundled but usually should not
be: ~3.6GB that F5-TTS and Whisper fetch on first use anyway.

Each check returns a Requirement, and every one of them is expected to
fail on a clean machine - that is the normal first-run state, not an
error. `blocking` marks the ones without which the app genuinely cannot
work, as opposed to those that only cost speed or polish.
