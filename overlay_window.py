"""Transparent desktop overlay host, run as its own process.

Great Sage's main window is pywebview + WinForms + WebView2, and that
stack CANNOT produce a transparent window: WebView2 renders into a child
HWND, and per-pixel alpha needs a composited TOP-LEVEL window. Measured
against a magenta backdrop, seven approaches all came back opaque -
transparent=True, WebView2's DefaultBackgroundColor, AllowTransparency
plus TransparencyKey, disabling GPU compositing, DWM blur-behind, and
re-parenting the render HWND.

Qt can. QWebEngineView is the same Chromium engine, so the Three.js
scene, the shaders and the WebGL context are all unchanged - only the
window hosting it differs. Verified before this file existed: over a
magenta backdrop, a WebGL canvas rendered correctly AND the backdrop
showed through the empty areas.

Run as a SEPARATE PROCESS on purpose. The main HUD keeps running exactly
as it does today, on the stack that already works; if this host has
trouble, the app it was launched from is untouched. It is also the only
way to have both, since Qt and WinForms each want to own the process's
GUI event loop.

    py overlay_window.py [--size 340] [--url http://...]

VERSION: PySide6 6.4.3, from the .overlay-venv (Python 3.11). This is
what FIXED the flicker, confirmed in use.

Qt 6.5.1 moved QtWebEngine to the ANGLE backend and translucent windows
have flickered on it since; 6.4.3 predates that. It cannot be installed
on Python 3.14 (PySide6 supports 3.14 only from 6.10), which is why the
overlay runs under its own interpreter - possible only because it is
already a separate process. run_hud.py prefers .overlay-venv when present.

Do NOT try to dodge the flicker by selecting a different graphics
backend: ANGLE is also what makes the window transparent here, and every
alternative either lost the transparency or stopped rendering entirely.

Also applied, both from the same investigation: WS_BORDER after show()
(QTBUG-51093) and AA_ShareOpenGLContexts + an alpha buffer in the default
surface format.

    # Chromium needs this before the QApplication exists, or the WebGL
    # surface comes back opaque even with the Qt attributes set.
    # VSYNC STAYS ON, and the frame rate STAYS CAPPED.
    #
    # --disable-gpu-vsync and --disable-frame-rate-limit were tried here as
    # flicker mitigations and did active harm:
    #   * uncapped frames ran the GPU flat out and spun the fans up, for a
    #     visual that only ever needs 60fps;
    #   * the HUD's animations advance PER FRAME, not per second
    #     (rotation.y += 0.0022), so more frames literally meant faster
    #     spinning - the wireframe visibly sped up;
    #   * disabling vsync CAUSES tearing, which on a translucent window
    #     looks like exactly the flicker it was meant to fix.
    # Removing them is not a compromise; keeping them was the mistake.
    #
    # NOT --disable-gpu-compositing. It was tried here as a flicker fix, on
    # the theory that a 340x340 window is cheap to composite in software.
    # Measured in use: about 3fps. Software compositing of a continuously
    # animating WebGL scene is far more expensive than the small window
    # size suggests, and an unusable frame rate is worse than the flicker
    # it was meant to cure.
    #
    # THE FLICKER: ANGLE. Qt 6.5.1 switched QtWebEngine to the ANGLE
    # backend (OpenGL translated to Direct3D), and translucent windows have
    # flickered since - reported against other Qt WebEngine apps, not just
    # this one. The usual advice is to pin Qt 6.4.3, which is not possible
    # here: PySide6 only supports Python 3.14 from 6.10 onward, so pip
    # offers 6.10.1 at the oldest.
    #
    # Selecting a different backend was tried and cannot work HERE, because
    # ANGLE is also what makes the transparency work. Measured, each
    # against a magenta backdrop:
    #
    #   --use-angle=gl        GPU context lost, nothing renders at all
    #   --use-angle=d3d9      failed to come up
    #   QT_OPENGL=desktop     renders, but the window is OPAQUE - the
    #                         desktop no longer shows through
    #
    # So the default ANGLE/D3D11 path stays. Escaping the flicker by
    # avoiding ANGLE would mean giving up the transparency the overlay
    # exists for.

    # rendering - Qt itself warns about this attribute for WebEngine.
    #
    # The explicit alpha buffer matters for a TRANSLUCENT window
